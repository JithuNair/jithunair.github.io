# A Brief

I am a seasoned Data Scientist from Pune, India with over 5 years of experience in the field. I hold a Masters degree in Data Science and Engineering and a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering, providing me with a strong foundation in both the technical and mathematical aspects of data science.

Currently, I am employed with Dentsu, where I have had the opportunity to work with clients from various industries, including media, automobile, social media, retail, and healthcare. My diverse experience has allowed me to bring unique insights and solutions to complex problems, making me an asset to any team.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a polyglot who knows 7 languages and is always eager to learn more. Outside of work, I have a wide range of interests, including anime, playing football and basketball, riding my skateboard, and listening to a variety of music. I also enjoy reading fantasy and fiction novels, with my favourite author being Brandon Sanderson.

Overall, I am a well-rounded individual who brings a combination of technical expertise and passion for learning to everything I do.
