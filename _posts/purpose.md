# Welcome

Hello, with nearly 5 years in the Analytics industry, I have honed my skills and gained valuable experience working with four organizations and a diverse array of clients across various industries. At the start of my career, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence were not a primary focus, but through my journey, they have become essential aspects of my work. The technologies required were Cloud Storages, Visualization tools and languages like Python to do a few things primarily:

* Automate Manual Work
* Analyze KPIs from Large Chunks of Data
* Visualize said Data using tools like Tableau

While these technologies and the technology stack will continue to be relevant in my career, I have always been eager to deepen my understanding of ML/AI. This is why I pursued a Master's degree, so that I could fully comprehend the concepts behind the codes I write. Now, the next challenge is to put my knowledge into practice.

This portfolio serves as a platform to document my journey as I delve into the world of Data Science and enhance my skills. It also serves as a source of inspiration for others who are looking to learn and grow in this field. I do not claim that my approach is the best, but I hope it provides some guidance for those who may be struggling. I am thoroughly enjoying this journey, and I hope you will too.
